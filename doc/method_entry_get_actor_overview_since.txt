**entry_get_actor_overview_since** (api_user, nick, limit, since_time)


Returns stream entries for a user's overview on or after a certain time.

  up to date as it is more efficient for you to only get the updates after the
  last polling time.

    * nick - the actor for whom to fetch the overview
    * limit - optional parameter; specifies how many entries to fetch

      * defaults to 30
      * max is 1000
    * since_time - optional parameter; specifies the datetime on or after which
      to retrieve entries

      * defaults to the beginning of time
      * see `request timestamp`_ for format
